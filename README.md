# learn-go

Personal repository to document my journey learning the Go programming language.

## Resources for getting started

### 1. The official [Go website](https://go.dev/)

No surprises here. The official website has a bunch of helpful resources for getting started. Quite a few resources, actually...

1. [Documentation page](https://go.dev/doc/)
   - Has a ton of individual tutorials, as well as actual formal documentation on the language itself
2. [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/)
3. [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) 
   - Was originally written for Go's release in 2009 and has not been updated significantly since. Reader should understand it is far from a complete guide. 
   - **I think I'll check this out after reviewing more basic tutorials**
